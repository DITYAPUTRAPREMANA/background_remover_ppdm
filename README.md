# People Segmentation Model

This project implements a deep learning model for semantic segmentation using U-Net architecture with a ResNet50 backbone. It processes images and masks, trains the model, and performs predictions on test images. The model uses TensorFlow and Keras.

## Project Structure

* **`segmentation_prep.py`**: Prepares the dataset by renaming images and masks, and updates the segmentation text files for training.
* **`train.py`**: The main script to train the U-Net model using the processed dataset. Includes data loading, preprocessing, and training with callbacks.
* **`train_limit.py`**: Similar to `train.py` but with added resource monitoring (CPU, RAM, GPU usage) to prevent system overload during training.
* **`model.py`**: Defines the architecture of the U-Net model with a ResNet50 backbone, including residual and dilated convolution blocks.
* **`predict.py`**: Makes predictions on test images and generates masked images based on the trained model.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_folder>
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download or prepare the dataset:

   * Organize your dataset into a folder with subdirectories `images` and `masks`. Ensure the images are in `.jpg` format and the masks in `.png` format.

## Usage

### 1. Prepare the Dataset

Run `segmentation_prep.py` to process the dataset. It will rename the images and masks according to the segmentation text files:

```bash
python segmentation_prep.py
```

### 2. Train the Model

To train the U-Net model with the processed dataset, use `train.py`:

```bash
python train.py
```

If you have a high-performance system, you can use `train_limit.py` for resource monitoring:

```bash
python train_limit.py
```

### 3. Make Predictions

After training, use `predict.py` to apply the model to new test images and generate segmentation masks:

```bash
python predict.py
```

The results will be saved in the `test/masks` directory.

## Model Architecture

The model uses U-Net architecture with a ResNet50 backbone. It includes the following layers:

* **Residual Blocks**: For better feature extraction and gradient flow.
* **Dilated Convolutions**: To capture multi-scale features.
* **Decoder Blocks**: For upsampling the feature maps and combining with skip connections.
* **Multi-Scale Outputs**: The final output consists of multiple scale predictions for better segmentation results.

## Notes

* The dataset and model are designed for semantic segmentation tasks.
* Make sure to adjust the dataset paths and configurations in the scripts as needed.
* The training process requires a high-performance GPU. If you are using a system with limited resources, you might need to adjust batch sizes and model parameters.
